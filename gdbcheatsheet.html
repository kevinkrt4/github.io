<h1>GDB Cheat Sheet</h1>

<h2>For C:</h2> 
    <p>gcc -g -Wall -Werr (source file)</p>
   
<h2>For GCC Assembler:</h2> 
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>as --gstabs --32 -o ./$1.o ./$1.s</li>
            <li>ld -melf_i386 -o ./$1.out ./$1.o</li>
        </ol>
        Where: $1 is the name of the file you want to assemble.
    </p>

    

    <h2>Loading the program into GDB</h2> 
    gdb --tui (executable)<br><br>
    --tui tells gdb to display the source-code window

    <h2>GDB Commands</h2>
    r (arg1 arg2 arg3...) runs the program with the given parameters<br>
    r (no arguments) re-runs with the previous set of arguments<br>

    <h2>Breakpoints</h2>
    b (location) location can be a label, line number, or function name
    info break  list breakpoints with their breakpoint id numbers
    d <breakpoint> to delete a breakpoint
    disable/enable <breakpoint> disables or enables a breakpoint without deleting it

    You can also make a breakpoint conditional if you only want to break when certain conditions are met:
    info breakpoints #to see the breakpoint id numbers
    condition <breakpoint id number> <condition under which you want to break>

    Moving up and down the call stack
    bt #Print a backtrace of the entire stack: one line per frame for all frames in the stack.
    up <N> #to move up the call stack N frames. if N is not specified up will move up one frame
    down <N> #to move down the call stack N frames. if N is not specified down will move down one frame

    Displaying values
    p <expression> #displays the value of expression, variable, or register
    display <expression> #displays the value of expression every time the program pauses (for example, at break points)
    info locals #show all local variables
    info args #show all arguments that were passed to the program
    info variables: #show values of all static and global variables
    info registers: #shows contents of all registers
    watch <expression> #monitors changes in an expression or variable

    Stepping through the program
    n #steps over function calls. skips over the function to the line after the end of the function
    s #steps into function calls. goes to the first line inside the function
    fin #finishes execution of the function you are in. goes to the line after the end of the function
    c #same as resume. runs till the next pause (break) is encountered

    Running operating system commands without leaving gdb
    shell <command> #let's you run linux commands without leaving gdb. For example: shell ls would show you a list of files in the current directory without leaving gdb
    make #reruns make without leaving gdb

    Selecting a gdb window
    focus cmd #sets focus on teh command window
    focus src #sets focus on the code window
